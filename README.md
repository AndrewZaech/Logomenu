Quick access menu for the GNOME panel with options that help ease the workflow for newcomers and power users alike.

Similar to the Apple Menu found on MacOS.


## Options include:

-About My System (opens a submenu in System Settings that shows info about your computer.)

-System Settings

-Software Center (defaults to `gnome-software`)

-Activities (this menu does replace the Activities button, but this option does leave that functionality easily accessible.)

-Force Quit App (run this and select the app you want to kill. Requires `xkill` )

-Terminal (defaults to `gnome-terminal`)

-Extensions (Quick access to all of your GNOME Extensions. Requires `gnome-extensions-app`)
